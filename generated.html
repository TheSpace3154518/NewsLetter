                <p>Okay, so Syria's having a *bit* of a rough patch. Interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa is calling for peace and unity – a nice thought, honestly – but things are falling apart at the seams. We're talking clashes between Syria's security forces and loyalists of the ousted Bashar al-Assad, leaving over 1,000 people dead in Latakia and Tartous as of Sunday. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights puts the civilian death toll at a grim 745, adding to the 125 security forces and 148 pro-Assad fighters who have also perished. <br><br> The fighting started with attacks by Assad supporters, escalating into what officials are calling a hunt for "remnants of the former regime." It’s gotten so messy, there’s even fighting around a gas power plant. UN rights chief Volker Turk wants investigations and accountability, while the US is urging Syria's authorities to hold those responsible for "massacres" accountable. <br><br> Meanwhile, things are complicated by infrastructure attacks; internet and telecommunications were down in Deraa and Sweida after a vital optic cable was damaged. Al-Sharaa insists Syria can survive these "expected challenges," and is attempting to form an inclusive cabinet including representatives from various ethnic and religious communities – a good strategy, considering how divided the country is right now. Basically, it’s a complicated situation, and the death toll is likely to climb.</p>
