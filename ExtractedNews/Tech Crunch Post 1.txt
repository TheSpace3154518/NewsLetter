OpenAI is embroiled in suits brought by authors, programmers, and other rights-holders who accuse the company of using their works — books, codebases, and so on — to develop its models without permission
The study, which was co-authored by researchers at the University of Washington, the University of Copenhagen, and Stanford, proposes a new method for identifying training data “memorized” by models behind an API, like OpenAI’s.

The co-authors probed several OpenAI models, including GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, for signs of memorization by removing high-surprisal words from snippets of fiction books and New York Times pieces and having the models try to “guess” which words had been masked

If the models managed to guess correctly, it’s likely they memorized the snippet during training, concluded the co-authors.
Most of the outputs aren’t verbatim copies of the training data, but owing to the way models “learn,” some inevitably are
According to the results of the tests, GPT-4 showed signs of having memorized portions of popular fiction books, including books in a dataset containing samples of copyrighted ebooks called BookMIA

OpenAI’s models ‘memorized’ copyrighted content, new study suggests
An example of having a model “guess” a high-surprisal word.

Teen with 4.0 GPA who built the viral Cal AI app was rejected by 15 top universities
Image models have been found to regurgitate screenshots from movies they were trained on, while language models have been observed effectively plagiarizing news articles.
The study’s method relies on words that the co-authors call “high-surprisal” — that is, words that stand out as uncommon in the context of a larger body of work
Models are prediction engines
“In order to have large language models that are trustworthy, we need to have models that we can probe and audit and examine scientifically,” Ravichander said. “Our work aims to provide a tool to probe large language models, but there is a real need for greater data transparency in the whole ecosystem.”
OpenAI has long advocated for looser restrictions on developing models using copyrighted data
The results also suggested that the model memorized portions of New York Times articles, albeit at a comparatively lower rate.
Abhilasha Ravichander, a doctoral student at the University of Washington and a co-author of the study, told TechCrunch that the findings shed light on the “contentious data” models might have been trained on.
For example, the word “radar” in the sentence “Jack and I sat perfectly still with the radar humming” would be considered high-surprisal because it’s statistically less likely than words such as “engine” or “radio” to appear before “humming.”

While the company has certain content licensing deals in place and offers opt-out mechanisms that allow copyright owners to flag content they’d prefer the company not use for training purposes, it has lobbied several governments to codify “fair use” rules around AI training approaches.

A new study appears to lend credence to allegations that OpenAI trained at least some of its AI models on copyrighted content.
