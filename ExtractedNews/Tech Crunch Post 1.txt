OpenAI today has a for-profit org controlled by a nonprofit, with a “capped profit” share for investors and employees.

The stakes are high for OpenAI to complete the conversion expeditiously. If it isn’t successful by the end of the year, at least one of its backers, SoftBank, could claw back billions of dollars in pledged capital.

“[T]he Board will consider these insights in its ongoing work to evolve the OpenAI nonprofit well before the end of 2025,” OpenAI wrote in a blog post. “The Board recognizes the importance of engaging with the philanthropic community and those closest to the work to help inform how OpenAI’s philanthropy can best deploy its potentially historic resources.”
OpenAI was founded in 2015 as a nonprofit research lab. But as its experiments became increasingly capital intensive, it created its current structure, taking on outside investments from VCs and companies, including Microsoft.
