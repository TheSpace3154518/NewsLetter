Researchers trained DeepCoder using reinforcement learning (RL) on 24,000 curated, verifiable coding problems over 2.5 weeks using 32 H100 GPUs
The new version improves upon its predecessor by eliminating human-authored templates and implementing a progressive agentic tree-search guided by an experiment manager agent
They developed several training innovations, including GRPO+ (a new, stabilized version of GRPO), iterative context lengthening, and various optimizations that accelerate RL training by up to 2.5 times
Despite being trained primarily for coding tasks, DeepCoder also shows strong math capabilities, scoring 73.8 percent on AIME 2024
OpenAI’s filing comes amid Musk’s lawsuit attempting to prevent the ChatGPT maker from transitioning to a for-profit model, which the company must complete by year-end to secure its $40 billion fundraising round
OpenAI claims Musk, a former co-founder who launched rival xAI in 2023, has tried to harm the company through press attacks, social media campaigns, and retaliatory legal claims after leaving the company
As a demonstration, AI Scientist-v2 generated three papers fully autonomously, one of which was accepted by ICLR, a peer-reviewed workshop
