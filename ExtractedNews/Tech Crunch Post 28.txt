An OpenAI spokesperson tells TechCrunch its new AI voice assistant for paying users is “more direct, engaging, concise, specific, and creative in its answers.”
Free users of ChatGPT now have access to a new version of Advanced Voice Mode that lets users pause,  without being interrupted, when speaking to the AI assistant. Paying users of ChatGPT — including subscribers to OpenAI’s Plus, Teams, Edu, Business, and Pro tiers — will also now get less frequent interruptions when using Advanced Voice Mode, as well as an improved personality for the voice assistant.

OpenAI released updates Monday for Advanced Voice Mode, its AI voice feature that enables real-time conversations in ChatGPT, to make the AI assistant more personable and interrupt users less frequently.
