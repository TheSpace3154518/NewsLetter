Previously, the least expensive tier was $20 per month, which provided 1 million points. A free plan is also available, but users can only ask a limited number of questions each day.
Poe, Quora’s chatbot app, launched one of its most affordable subscription options on Tuesday, priced at just $5 per month.

In addition, the company introduced its highest-priced plan at $250 per month, designed for users who need to send a large volume of messages on Poe.
Poe allows users to utilize several AI-powered bots — including DeepSeek-R1, GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, o3-mini, ElevenLabs, and more — in one place. It operates on a point system, enabling users to spend points across different models, with each bot having its own point cost per message.
Under the new $5/month plan, users can spend up to 10,000 points per day. In contrast, the $250/month tier offers 12.5 million points, which the company says is better for more “expensive” models, such as GPT-4.5, OpenAI’s o1-pro, and Google DeepMind’s Veo 2.
