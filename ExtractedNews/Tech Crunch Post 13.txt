OpenAI adopts rival Anthropic’s standard for connecting AI models to data
In a post on X on Wednesday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that OpenAI will add support for Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol, or MCP, across its products, including the desktop app for ChatGPT. MCP is an open source standard that helps AI models produce better, more relevant responses to certain queries.
Developers can expose data through “MCP servers” and build “MCP clients” — for instance, apps and workflows — that connect to those servers on command. In the months since Anthropic open sourced MCP, companies including Block, Apollo, Replit, Codeium, and Sourcegraph have added MCP support for their platforms.
“People love MCP and we are excited to add support across our products,” Altman said. “[It’s] available today in the Agents SDK and support for [the] ChatGPT desktop app [and] Responses API [is] coming soon!”
