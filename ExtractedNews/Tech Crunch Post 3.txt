On Friday, GitHub announced “premium requests” for GitHub Copilot, a new system that imposes rate limits when users switch to AI models other than the base model for tasks such as “agentic” coding and multi-file edits
While GitHub Copilot subscribers can still take unlimited actions with the base model (OpenAI’s GPT-4o), tasks and actions with newer models, like Anthropic’s 3.7 Sonnet, will now be capped.

Reasoning models like 3.7 Sonnet take more time to fact-check their answers, making them more reliable — but also increasing the computing needed to run them.
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said last August that Copilot accounted for over 40% of GitHub’s revenue growth in 2024 and is already a larger business than all of GitHub when the tech giant acquired it roughly seven years ago.
