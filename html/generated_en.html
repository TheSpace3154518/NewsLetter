                <div class="email-content"><p>Syria's interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa called for "peace and calm" this weekend—right as the country descended into its bloodiest clashes in years. The coastal regions of Latakia and Tartous have become battlegrounds, with hundreds dead in just four days. Who said irony was dead? [Post's Source from user query](https://www.aljazeera.com/)  

### The Grim Math  
- **745+ Alawite civilians** killed (per UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights)  
- **125 security forces** and **148 pro-Assad fighters** dead  
- **Total toll: 1,018** (and counting, as bodies are still being discovered)  

The violence erupted after loyalists of ousted President Bashar al-Assad attacked security forces, sparking revenge killings. Meanwhile, al-Sharaa insisted Syria has "characteristics for survival" in a mosque speech—presumably not referring to the *survival horror* unfolding in Tartous.  

### Who’s Accountable?  
UN rights chief Volker Turk demanded investigations, while the U.S. urged Syria’s interim gov to hold perpetrators responsible. Spoiler: No one’s holding their breath.  

### Infrastructure Woes  
Telecoms crashed in Deraa and Sweida after optical cables were cut—because nothing says "chaos" like losing Wi-Fi mid-massacre.  

**Bottom Line:** Syria’s "unity" cabinet now includes Alawites, Kurds, and Christians. Too bad unity doesn’t extend to the streets. </p></div>
